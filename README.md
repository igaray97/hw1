CP1 Homework 1
For this week the homework was to create accounts for GitHub and P5.js Editor, we were also assigened to experiment and change the file bubbles.js to see what we could change on the file.
I've added the file to the repository, as well as the answers to the questions, and a screen shot of an error in the inspector for question 3.
